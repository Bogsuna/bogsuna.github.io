        <p>According to Kendra Cherry, motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what causes you to act, whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge.<br>
            Motivation involves the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive forces that activate behavior. In everyday usage, the term "motivation" is frequently used to describe why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions.( https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-motivation-2795378, 2020). <br><br>
            There are two types of motivation: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation.<br>
            According to Chris Cebollero, intrinsic motivation is when motivation comes from "internal" factors to meet personal needs. We do things we do because we enjoy them,  not because we have to. Intrinsic means internal or inside of yourself; when you are intrinsically motivated, you enjoy an interest, a course of study or skill development solely for the fulfillment of education and having fun. Examples include exploring opportunities for personal development for the satisfaction of being competent in a task, or setting the standards to become a role model or mentor. Whatever you take on, you do it for personal accomplishment and gratification. (Chris Cebollero, 2014)<br><br>
            According to A. Rochaun Meadows-Fernandez, extrinsic motivation is reward-driven behavior. It’s a type of operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is a form of behavior modification that uses rewards or punishments to increase or decrease the likelihood that specific behaviors will recur.<br>
            In extrinsic motivation, rewards or other incentives — like praise, fame, or money — are used as motivation for specific activities. Unlike intrinsic motivation, external factors drive this form of motivation. <br>
            Being paid to do a job is an example of extrinsic motivation. You may enjoy spending your day doing something other than work, but you’re motivated to go to work because you need a paycheck to pay your bills. In this example, you’re extrinsically motivated by the ability to afford your daily expenses. In return, you work a set number of hours a week to receive pay.<br>
            Extrinsic motivation doesn’t always have a tangible reward. It can also be done through abstract rewards, like praise and fame.( A. Rochaun Meadows-Fernandez, 2018)<br><br>
            According to Dan Pink, the extrinsic motivation dulls thinking and blocks creativity. This statement is proved by experiment(the candle problem). There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. The business continues to work with the reward-and-punishment approach. However, the autonomy-mastery-purpose approach (Intrinsic motivation) is more efficient way of working. When people do something because they want to do it, their results are much better than when they do it because of bonuses, commissions, etc. Dan Pink believes that if we get past the lazy, dangerous, ideology of carrots and sticks, we can strengthen our business and change the world.

        <summary><h3 class="h-center">Performance motivation</h3></summary>
        <p>I sometimes have a strong drive for completing important tasks, but I will often not be driven if I do not feel the task is important enough, however I am very motivated by seeking reward for your behavior. The offer of a reward (such as a promotion for working hard or winning a bet) will keep me motivated to complete difficult activities. I enjoy activities that I see as increasing my happiness, such as gatherings with friends and families or enjoyable activities. I also can be impulsive at times. I am motivated to avoid things that I don't like. This can sometimes mean trying to avoid activities I don't enjoy, or attempting to escape punishment or pain. Sometimes I feel nervous.<br><br>

            Conclusion: I agree with the statement that I have a strong drive for completing important tasks. I am looking forward to seeing the result of my work after I finish my task. For instance, the feedback about my website during the PCO1. It is important for me to be good at things that I want to be successful. For example, the application assignment that I made was evaluated as “very functional”. In addition, I agree with the statement that I enjoy activities that increase my happiness.  The activities which bring you happiness are essential part of the life of the successful people. For example, if you work something that you like, you will show your best performance.

                <p>The two most important values for me are structure and working conditions. The structure is essential because I need to know how something should be done, to have framework. If there is clear framework, my job will be done in the way it should be done. The working conditions are another important part for me due to the fact I need good surroundings to do my best. Both of the values are connected with the internal motivation. These values help me to enjoy the things I do. The least important value for me is variety. It is because I like to work in structure.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, I believe that motivation is the force that make me to do my best. If you do not have motivation, you will have not desire to continue developing your skills in specific area. I have the motivation to develop myself in the area of ICT. As a result, I am a student in the HZ University and follow my goals.<br><br>
                My family agree with my statements about the motivation. They know me the best and always support me to achieve my goals. They believe that motivation is the most important part of the developing yourself as a character and professional.
